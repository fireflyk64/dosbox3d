/*
 *  Which game is running, and where.
 *
 *  DOS_Execute reports every program it loads (wc_net_program_loaded); when
 *  it is one of the executables the hooks know, the data-segment map
 *  (wcnet_ds.def -> ds::...) and the code addresses (code::...) are loaded
 *  for it, relative to the segment DOS put it at.  While no such program
 *  runs, DS is 0, every code::Loc is unknown and the per-instruction hook
 *  does nothing game specific.
 *
 *  There are two games and five executables: The Secret Missions 2 is
 *  Wing Commander's program built again (SM2.EXE), the two Special
 *  Operations are Wing Commander II's (SO1.EXE, SO2.EXE).  What the code
 *  asks is which game it is (is_wc1(), is_wc2()); the build only picks the
 *  addresses.
