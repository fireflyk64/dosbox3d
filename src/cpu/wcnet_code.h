/*
 *  Code addresses used by the multiplayer hooks, for the game that is running.
 *
 *  The Wing Commander executables are Borland overlay programs.  Overlay
 *  functions are reached through a stub segment holding `jmp far` thunks (one
 *  every 5 bytes from offset 0x20); the overlay code itself is loaded at a
 *  run-time dependent segment, so a hook on an overlay function compares CS
 *  against the segment currently stored in the thunk and IP against the
 *  function's fixed offset.  Root-image code sits at a fixed distance from
 *  the program's load segment.
 *
 *  Address forms (all resolvable with scripts/wcexe.py):
 *     stub143:0084  -> thunk; its segment is load segment + the stub's paragraph
 *     ovr143:0A99   -> offset inside the overlay
 *     seg001:20E3   -> root image
 *
 *  The values are loaded by wcnet_game.cpp when DOS starts a known program.
